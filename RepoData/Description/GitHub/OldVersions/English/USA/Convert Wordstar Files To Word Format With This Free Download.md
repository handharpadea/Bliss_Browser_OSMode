## Why Convert Wordstar Documents to Word?
 
Wordstar was one of the first word processors to offer features such as spell check, mail merge, and macros. It was widely used by writers, journalists, and academics, who appreciated its simplicity and speed. However, Wordstar was also known for its complex keyboard commands and compatibility issues with other formats and devices.
 
As technology evolved, Wordstar was gradually replaced by more advanced and user-friendly word processors, such as Microsoft Word. Today, Word is the most widely used word processor in the world, and it can open and edit almost any document format. However, Word cannot directly open or save Wordstar documents, which means that you may lose access to your old files if you don't convert them.
