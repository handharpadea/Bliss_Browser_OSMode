# How to Customize Your Sonic Generations Graphics Config
 
If you are a fan of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games, you might have played Sonic Generations, a 2011 platformer that celebrates the 20th anniversary of the franchise. The game features two versions of Sonic, one from the original 2D games and one from the modern 3D games, as they team up to restore the timeline that has been altered by a mysterious entity.
 
Sonic Generations is a fun and nostalgic game that offers a lot of replay value with its different levels, challenges, and collectibles. However, some players might want to tweak the graphics settings of the game to suit their preferences and system capabilities. For example, you might want to increase or decrease the resolution, enable or disable anti-aliasing, adjust the shadow quality, or change the frame rate limit.

Fortunately, there is a way to customize your Sonic Generations graphics config using a simple text editor. Here are the steps to do it:
 
1. Locate the Sonic Generations folder on your computer. It is usually found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sonic Generations.
2. Open the folder and find the file named "GraphicsConfig.cfg". This is the file that contains the graphics settings of the game.
3. Right-click on the file and select "Open with". Choose a text editor of your choice, such as Notepad or WordPad.
4. You will see a list of parameters and values that correspond to different graphics options. You can modify these values according to your liking. For example, if you want to change the resolution to 1920x1080, you can edit the line that says "Resolution = 1280x720" to "Resolution = 1920x1080".
5. Save the file and close the text editor. You can now launch Sonic Generations and enjoy your customized graphics config.

Note: Be careful when editing the file and make sure you backup a copy before making any changes. If you encounter any problems or errors after modifying the file, you can restore the original file or delete it and let the game generate a new one with default settings.

One of the best features of Sonic Generations is the ability to switch between the classic and modern Sonic gameplay styles. The classic Sonic levels are based on the 2D side-scrolling platformers of the Sega Genesis era, while the modern Sonic levels are inspired by the 3D games of the Dreamcast and later consoles. Each level has two acts, one for each Sonic, and they offer different perspectives and challenges on the same stage.
 
Another feature that adds variety and replay value to Sonic Generations is the skill system. You can unlock and equip different skills for both Sonics using skill points that you earn by completing levels and challenges. Some skills are exclusive to one Sonic, while others can be used by both. For example, you can equip the homing attack for classic Sonic, or the light speed dash for modern Sonic. You can also mix and match skills to create your own custom loadout.
 
Sonic Generations also has a lot of bonus content and easter eggs for fans of the series. You can unlock artwork, music, and videos from previous Sonic games by collecting red star rings hidden in each level. You can also access a sound test mode that lets you play any music track from the game or from other Sonic titles. You can even find a secret statue room that contains 3D models of various characters and objects from the Sonic universe.
