However, electric power transmission also involves various challenges and complexities, such as losses, voltage regulation, stability, protection, and planning. To understand these aspects of electric power transmission, one needs a solid foundation of the theory and practice of this field.
  
One of the best resources for learning about electric power transmission is the book "Transmisi Daya Listrik" by T.S. Hutauruk, a professor of electrical engineering at Institut Teknologi Bandung in Indonesia. This book was published in 1985 by Erlangga and covers various topics related to electric power transmission, such as transmission lines, transformers, reactive power compensation, load flow analysis, fault analysis, and economic dispatch.
  
The book is written in Indonesian and has 170 pages with illustrations and examples. It also includes a bibliography and an index. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of electrical engineering, as well as professionals and researchers in the field.
  
However, the book is not widely available online and may be hard to find in physical libraries. That is why we have created this comprehensive guide to electric power transmission based on the book "Transmisi Daya Listrik Hutauruk Pdf 27". This guide will summarize the main concepts and formulas from the book and provide links to relevant online resources for further reading.

So, without further ado, let us begin our journey into the world of electric power transmission with Chapter 1: Transmission Lines.
  
## Chapter 1: Transmission Lines
  
Transmission lines are the main components of electric power transmission. They are used to carry electric power from generation sources to substations and from substations to load centers. Transmission lines can be classified into three types: overhead lines, underground cables, and submarine cables.
  
Overhead lines are the most common type of transmission lines. They consist of conductors suspended by towers or poles above the ground. Overhead lines have several advantages, such as low cost, easy installation and maintenance, and high reliability. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as exposure to weather conditions, electromagnetic interference, corona losses, and visual impact.
  
Underground cables are transmission lines that are buried under the ground. They are used to transmit electric power in urban areas or in places where overhead lines are not feasible or desirable. Underground cables have several advantages, such as protection from weather conditions, reduced electromagnetic interference, lower corona losses, and improved aesthetics. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as high cost, difficult installation and maintenance, and lower reliability.
  
Submarine cables are transmission lines that are laid under the sea. They are used to transmit electric power across water bodies or between islands. Submarine cables have several advantages, such as protection from weather conditions, reduced electromagnetic interference, lower corona losses, and increased security. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as high cost, difficult installation and maintenance, and higher risk of damage.
  
The performance of transmission lines depends on several factors, such as the length, the cross-sectional area, the material, the configuration, and the voltage level of the line. These factors affect the resistance, the inductance, and the capacitance of the line, which in turn affect the impedance, the admittance, the power factor, and the voltage drop of the line.
  
To analyze the behavior of transmission lines, various models can be used depending on the length and the frequency of the line. For short lines (less than 80 km), a lumped parameter model can be used. For medium lines (between 80 km and 250 km), a nominal pi model or a nominal T model can be used. For long lines (more than 250 km), a distributed parameter model or a hyperbolic model can be used.
