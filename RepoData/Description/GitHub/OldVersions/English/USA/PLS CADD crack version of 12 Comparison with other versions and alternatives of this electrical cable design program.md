PLS-CADD 16.20 has many features and advantages that make it a superior choice for overhead line design and drafting. Some of these features are:
 
- It supports a wide range of technologies for line surveys, including total station instruments, airborne lasers and photogrammetry. It can import survey data in both the plan and profile coordinate systems.
- It has a customizable data import routine that can read a wide range of survey data formats.
- It has an optimum spotting option that enables automatic selection of structure locations and types for the least cost design of a line.
- It has a finite element sag-tension option that provides a more accurate alternative to the built-in ruling span sag-tension.
- It has a PLS-POLE integration that allows for the analysis and design of poles and towers within PLS-CADD.
- It has a streamlined version called PLS-Distribution that is designed specifically for the distribution side of the grid.

PLS-CADD 16.20 is compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1/10 and supports 64 bits. It comes with all the necessary files to install and activate the software permanently. It also includes a detailed install guide and can be installed on as many computers as you want.

In this article, we will explain what PLS-POLE is and how it works with PLS-CADD. PLS-POLE is a software that allows for the analysis and design of poles and towers for overhead lines. It can handle both wood and steel structures, as well as lattice towers and guyed masts. It can also model various types of foundations, such as concrete, helical, or caisson.
 
PLS-POLE can be used as a standalone program or as an integrated module within PLS-CADD. When used with PLS-CADD, PLS-POLE can automatically import the structure geometry, loading, and material data from the PLS-CADD model. It can also export the structure results back to PLS-CADD for clearance and sag-tension calculations. This integration allows for a seamless workflow between the two programs and eliminates the need for manual data entry or transfer.
 
PLS-POLE has many features and advantages that make it a powerful tool for pole and tower design. Some of these features are:

- It has a graphical user interface that allows for easy input and output of data.
- It has a comprehensive library of standard pole and tower shapes, as well as user-defined shapes.
- It has a built-in code checking feature that can check the structure against various design codes and standards, such as NESC, ASCE, ANSI, CSA, etc.
- It has a dynamic analysis feature that can perform modal analysis, harmonic analysis, transient analysis, and seismic analysis of the structure.
- It has a report generation feature that can produce detailed reports of the structure design, including diagrams, tables, charts, and drawings.
