## Limitations and Risks of Facebook Friends Mapper
 
Facebook Friends Mapper is a powerful tool that can help you find out more about someone's social network, but it also has some limitations and risks that you should be aware of before using it.

- The extension only works if you have at least one mutual friend with your target. If you don't have any mutual friends with them, you won't be able to see their hidden friends list.
- The extension may not work if your target has changed their privacy settings to prevent third-party apps from accessing their data.
- The extension may not work if Facebook has patched the loophole that allows it to bypass the hidden friends feature.
- The extension may violate Facebook's terms of service and privacy policy, and could get you banned from using Facebook if detected.
- The extension may expose your own hidden friends list to other users who have the extension installed and have a mutual friend with you.
- The extension may compromise your security and privacy by collecting your data or injecting malware into your browser.

Therefore, use Facebook Friends Mapper at your own risk and discretion, and respect the privacy of other users. Do not use it for malicious purposes or harassment. Be careful about what information you share online and who you trust.
