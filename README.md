  <p>üå≥Ô∏èüåêÔ∏èüíªÔ∏è The OS mode for Bliss Browser lets you turn your computer into a netbook for as much time as you choose. A privacy-focused alternative to ChromeOS/ChromiumOS</p>

## Intro

OS Mode for Bliss Browser is a framework for the browser that turns the interface into a graphical shell similar to FirefoxOS, ChromeOS, and other netbook operating systems. **The OSMode shell is not an operating system**, it runs on top of one. It is designed to make a computer into a Netbook, until the user decides to disable it (via Bliss Browser settings) and have it just be a browser application within their operating system once more.

### Netbook definition

I may be outspoken here, but I believe that Netbook is still the relevant term for a computer that only runs a web browser.
