If you are taking a math course that requires you to use Mymathlab, you might be wondering how to get an access code without paying a fortune. Mymathlab is an online platform that allows you to do homework, quizzes, and tests for your math class. It also provides you with an e-textbook and other resources to help you learn. However, Mymathlab is not free. You need to purchase an access code to use it, either from your bookstore or directly from Pearson, the publisher of Mymathlab.

According to some students on Reddit[^1^] [^2^], buying an access code from your bookstore can be a scam. They claim that you can pay much less if you buy the access code directly from the website of Mymathlab. All you need is a class code from your instructor and a credit card. You can also choose to buy only the online access code, without the e-textbook or the hard copy of the textbook, if you don't need them. This way, you can save up to $100 or more on your Mymathlab access code.
 
However, this method may not work for all colleges or all courses. Some students say that their bookstore charges the same price as the website, or even less. Some instructors may also require you to have the e-textbook or the hard copy of the textbook for their course. Therefore, it is always a good idea to check with your instructor and your bookstore before buying an access code online.
 
Another option that some students suggest is to buy a used or "cracked" access code from places like Amazon or eBay. These are access codes that have been previously used by someone else, but may still work for your course. However, this option is very risky and not recommended. You may end up buying an expired or invalid access code, or one that does not match your course or edition of the textbook. You may also violate the terms and conditions of Pearson by using an unauthorized access code. If you get caught, you may face serious consequences such as losing your access to Mymathlab, getting a zero on your assignments, or even getting expelled from your college.
 
Therefore, the best way to save money on Mymathlab access codes is to do your research and compare prices before buying one. You can also try to complete your course during the free trial period of Mymathlab, which usually lasts for 2 or 3 weeks. However, this option may not be feasible for everyone, as it requires you to finish all your homework and tests in a very short time.
 
Mymathlab can be a useful tool for learning math, but it can also be very expensive. By following these tips, you may be able to find a cheaper and legal way to get an access code for your course.
  
If you are looking for more ways to save money on Mymathlab access codes, you may also want to check out some alternatives to Mymathlab.
