## A Brief History of Zaccaria Pinball
 
Zaccaria Pinball is a tribute to the Zaccaria company, which was founded by three brothers: Marino, Franco and Natale Zaccaria in Bologna, Italy in 1974. The company started as a distributor of arcade games and pinball machines from other manufacturers, such as Bally and Williams. However, soon they decided to create their own pinball machines, using their own designs and technology. Their first pinball machine was called The Invaders and was released in 1974. It was followed by many other successful titles, such as Locomotion, Devil Riders, Pinball Champ, Farfalla, Blackbelt, Robot and Hot Wheels.
 
Zaccaria became one of the leading pinball manufacturers in Europe and the world, competing with the American giants Bally and Williams. They were known for their innovative and creative features, such as the use of magnets, ramps, multiball modes, speech synthesis and digital displays. They also experimented with different themes and genres, such as sci-fi, fantasy, horror, sports and music. Some of their most popular tables were based on licensed properties, such as Star's Phoenix (inspired by Star Wars), Zankor (inspired by Conan the Barbarian) and Mexico '86 (inspired by the FIFA World Cup).
 
However, in the late 1980s, the pinball industry faced a decline due to the rise of video games and home consoles. Zaccaria struggled to keep up with the changing market and faced financial difficulties. In 1987, they released their last pinball machine: Magic Castle. The company went bankrupt shortly after and closed its doors. The Zaccaria brothers moved on to other ventures, such as producing slot machines and vending machines. Their legacy, however, lives on in the hearts and minds of pinball enthusiasts around the world.
