  <H1>Bliss Browser OSMode</H1>
  <p>üå≥Ô∏èüåêÔ∏èüíªÔ∏è The OS mode for Bliss Browser lets you turn your computer into a netbook for as much time as you choose. A privacy-focused alternative to ChromeOS/ChromiumOS</p>

## Intro

OS Mode for Bliss Browser is a framework for the browser that turns the interface into a graphical shell similar to FirefoxOS, ChromeOS, and other netbook operating systems. **The OSMode shell is not an operating system**, it runs on top of one. It is designed to make a computer into a Netbook, until the user decides to disable it (via Bliss Browser settings) and have it just be a browser application within their operating system once more.

### Netbook definition

I may be outspoken here, but I believe that Netbook is still the relevant term for a computer that only runs a web browser.

### Similar projects

> **Note** This list is in A-Z order. Also, these projects are listed because they have similar aspects to Bliss Browser OSMode, but are mostly completely different in design.

- ChromeOS/ChromiumOS - A netbook operating system that is mainly a web browser operating system, although with a very bad privacy record
- FirefoxOS - A discontinued privacy friendly netbook operating system that was replaced by Google ChromeOS/Google ChromiumOS
- Windows 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, and 3.1x (Windows 1.0 - Windows 3.11) - a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS
- Windows 9x (Windows 95, 98, ME) - a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS
