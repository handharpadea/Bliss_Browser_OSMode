# How to Download and Use Geo Sans Bold Font
 
Geo Sans Bold is a simple geometric typeface that is inspired by some of the experimental faces designed during the 1920s by well-known modernists such as Theo van Doesberg and Herbert Bayer. It expresses both the directness of the 1920s faces and the rather disingenuous consumerist thrust of their 80s and 90s descendants[^1^].
