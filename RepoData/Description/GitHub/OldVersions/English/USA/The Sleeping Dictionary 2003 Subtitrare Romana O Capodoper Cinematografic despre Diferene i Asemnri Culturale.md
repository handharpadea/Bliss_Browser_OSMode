However, John still loves Selima and is determined to find her. He learns that she has been sold to a local prince and is now his fourth wife. He goes to the palace and tries to rescue her, but is captured and sentenced to death. Selima begs the prince to spare John's life, and he agrees on one condition: she must never see John again. John is released and sent back to Britain with Cecilia.
 
Years later, after World War II, John returns to Sarawak as the new governor. He is reunited with Henry and Aggie, who have adopted Selima's daughter. John realizes that the girl is his daughter too, and that Selima never told him that she was pregnant when they parted. He also learns that Selima died of malaria a few years ago. He decides to stay in Sarawak and raise his daughter with the help of Henry and Aggie. He also plans to make reforms for the benefit of the local people, inspired by Selima's memory.
