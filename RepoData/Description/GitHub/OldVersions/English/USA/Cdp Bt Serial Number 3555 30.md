If you have an old Autocom CDP+ interface with serial number 3555 and you want to use it with the latest software version (2017 r1 or r3), you may encounter some problems. The interface may not be recognized by the software or it may fail the test. This article will show you how to solve these issues and update your interface successfully.
 
## Step 1: Check your hardware key and ID
 
The first thing you need to do is to check your hardware key and ID. These are two codes that identify your interface and allow the software to activate it. You can find them on a sticker on the back of your interface or in a readme file that came with your software. For example, for serial number 3555, the hardware key may be MNZTTOOCNHVE and the ID may be a-710-479. Write down these codes and keep them handy.

## Step 2: Download and install the correct software version
 
The next step is to download and install the correct software version for your interface. You can find the software on the official website of Autocom or on some online forums. Make sure you choose the version that matches your interface type (CDP BT) and your serial number (3555). For example, for serial number 3555, you should use software version 30250. Do not use software version 100251 or 100250 as they are for different interface types.
 
## Step 3: Patch the software files
 
The third step is to patch the software files to make them compatible with your interface. You can find the patch files on some online forums or you can request them from someone who has them. The patch files are usually named Main.exe, Main.dll, DS150E.exe, DS150E.dll, etc. You need to replace the original files in your software folder with the patch files. Make sure you backup the original files before you do this.
 
## Step 4: Generate and copy the activation file
 
The final step is to generate and copy the activation file for your interface. The activation file is a XML file that contains your hardware key, ID and some other information. You can generate it using a keygen program that you can find on some online forums or you can request it from someone who has it. You need to enter your hardware key and ID into the keygen program and click generate. Then you need to copy the activation file (FileActivation.xml) into your software folder.
