Realflight is a popular and realistic RC flight simulator that requires an InterLink controller to operate. However, some users may want to use their own controllers or joysticks instead of the InterLink, which can be expensive or hard to find. In this case, they may resort to using a dongle emulator, which is a software that tricks the simulator into thinking that an InterLink is connected.

One of the most widely used dongle emulators for Realflight is version 3.4.18, which works with Realflight G2, G3, G4 and G5. However, using a dongle emulator is not legal or supported by the developers of Realflight, and may cause various problems or errors. Therefore, this article is for educational purposes only and does not endorse or encourage piracy or illegal use of software.
 
To use Realflight Dongle Emulator 3.4.18, you will need the following:
 
- A copy of Realflight G2, G3, G4 or G5 installed on your computer.
- A controller or joystick that is compatible with Windows and has at least four channels.
- A USB adapter that can connect your controller or joystick to your computer.
- The Realflight Dongle Emulator 3.4.18 software, which can be downloaded from various sources on the internet (use at your own risk).

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Connect your controller or joystick to your computer using the USB adapter.
2. Run the Windows calibration tool and make sure that your controller or joystick is recognized and working properly.
3. Run the Realflight Dongle Emulator 3.4.18 software and select the version of Realflight that you have installed (G2, G3, G4 or G5).
4. Click on "Start Emulation" and wait for a message that says "Dongle Emulation Successful".
5. Run Realflight and enjoy flying with your own controller or joystick.

Note that some features of Realflight may not work properly with a dongle emulator, such as online multiplayer, updates or expansions. Also, some controllers or joysticks may not be fully compatible with Realflight and may require additional configuration or tweaking. Finally, using a dongle emulator may expose your computer to viruses or malware, so be careful when downloading or running any software from unknown sources.
 
The best way to enjoy Realflight is to use the official InterLink controller that comes with the simulator, which provides realistic and accurate control over your RC models. However, if you are unable to get an InterLink or prefer to use your own controller or joystick, you can try using a dongle emulator at your own risk and responsibility.

## Alternatives to Using a Dongle Emulator
 
If you are not comfortable with using a dongle emulator for Realflight, there are some alternatives that you can consider. Here are some of them:
 
**Buy an InterLink:**
 
The best and most recommended option is to buy an InterLink controller that comes with Realflight. This way, you can enjoy the full features and benefits of Realflight without any hassle or risk. You can also get updates and expansions for Realflight that will enhance your simulation experience. You can buy an InterLink from the official Realflight website or from authorized dealers.
 
**Use a Different Simulator:**
 
If you are not satisfied with Realflight or cannot afford an InterLink, you can try using a different RC flight simulator that does not require an InterLink or a dongle emulator. There are many other simulators available on the market, such as Phoenix RC, AeroFly RC, Heli-X RC and more. Some of them may even be compatible with your controller or joystick without any additional software. However, they may not have the same level of realism or quality as Realflight.
 
**Use a Real RC Model:**
 
If you want to experience the thrill and challenge of flying a real RC model, you can skip the simulator altogether and buy a real RC model. There are many types and sizes of RC models available for beginners and experts alike, such as planes, helicopters, drones and more. You can also join a local RC club or community where you can learn from other enthusiasts and have fun flying together. However, flying a real RC model requires more time, money and skill than flying a simulator.
