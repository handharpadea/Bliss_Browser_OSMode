Bachna Ae Haseeno movie has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some of the aspects that were appreciated by the reviewers were:

1. **The soundtrack**: The film boasts of a catchy and melodious soundtrack composed by Vishal-Shekhar, with lyrics by Anvita Dutt Guptan. The songs range from the peppy title track, which is a tribute to the original song by Kishore Kumar, to the romantic "Khuda Jaane", which won several awards for its singers KK and Shilpa Rao. The other songs like "Lucky Boy", "Jogi Mahi", and "Aahista Aahista" are also enjoyable and well-picturized.
2. **The cinematography**: The film showcases some beautiful locations in Switzerland, Mumbai, Sydney, and Amritsar. The camera work by Sunil Patel captures the scenic beauty and the urban charm of these places with finesse. The film also has a vibrant and colorful look that suits its mood and tone.
3. **The costumes**: The film features some stylish and trendy outfits worn by the lead actors, especially the actresses. Bipasha Basu sizzles in her glamorous avatar as a model and an item girl, while Deepika Padukone impresses with her chic and casual look as a student and a cab driver. Minissha Lamba also looks cute and innocent in her traditional attire as a Punjabi girl.
4. **The performance by Bipasha Basu**: Among the four lead actors, Bipasha Basu stands out with her confident and convincing portrayal of Radhika, a small-town girl who dreams of becoming a star. She displays a range of emotions from happiness to anger to sadness with ease and grace. She also shares a good chemistry with Ranbir Kapoor and makes their track interesting to watch.

However, the film also has some drawbacks that were pointed out by the critics, such as:

1. **The inconsistency and implausibility of the plot**: The film suffers from a weak script that lacks logic and coherence. The film tries to cover three different love stories in different time periods, but fails to connect them properly or justify their outcomes. The film also relies on clichÃ©s and coincidences to move the story forward. For instance, Raj happens to meet Mahi again after 12 years in Amritsar, where he also meets his childhood friend Joginder (Kunal Kapoor), who happens to be Mahi's husband. Similarly, Raj happens to meet Radhika again after 6 years in Mumbai, where she happens to be a famous actress who is shooting for his video game.
2. **The length and pace of the film**: The film is too long at 152 minutes and drags in the second half. The film loses its momentum and charm as it shifts from comedy to drama. The film also takes too long to reach its climax, which is predictable and melodramatic. The film could have been edited better to make it more crisp and engaging.
3. **The performance by Ranbir Kapoor**: While Ranbir Kapoor shows potential as an actor, he fails to deliver a convincing performance as Raj Sharma, the heartbreaker who reforms himself. He lacks the charisma and charm required for such a role and comes across as bland and boring. He also does not have much chemistry with his co-stars, except for Bipasha Basu. He needs to work on his expressions and dialogue delivery to make an impact.

Overall, Bachna Ae Haseeno movie is a decent watch if you are looking for some light-hearted entertainment with some good music and visuals. However, do not expect much from the story or the performances, as they are not very impressive or memorable.
